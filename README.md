# Scientific Computing Projects

This repository contains the implementations for two final projects from the "Introduction to Scientific Computing" course for the academic year 2023/2024 for the degree in mathematics at the university of Bologna. 

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

1. `sol-p1`: Contains the implementation for Project 1 - The Helmholtz Equation and Acoustic Pressure
2. `sol-p2`: Contains the implementation for Project 2 - Uncertainty Quantification in Stationary Heat Diffusion Using Finite Element Methods

The reposotory contains olso the problem statemets and experimental reports.

## Project 1: The Helmholtz Equation and Acoustic Pressure

Located in the `sol-p1` folder, this project focuses on solving the Helmholtz equation in the context of acoustic pressure. The main components include:

- Implementation of the linear finite element method to approximate the weak solution of the Helmholtz equation
- Comparison between the exact and approximate solutions
- Numerical study of the method's convergence
- Analysis of the method's behavior with increasing wave numbers

## Project 2: Uncertainty Quantification in Stationary Heat Diffusion

Located in the `sol-p2` folder, this project deals with uncertainty quantification in a stationary heat diffusion problem. The main components include:

- Derivation and implementation of the variational formulation for the weak solution
- Numerical approximation using the linear finite element method
- Implementation of the Monte Carlo finite element method (MC-FEM) for estimating the expected value of the quantity of interest
- Convergence analysis of the MC-FEM estimator
